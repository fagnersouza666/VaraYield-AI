- **Automated Rebalancing**: Dynamic fund reallocation based on changing APRs
- **Risk Customization**: User-defined risk levels (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
- **Protocol Integration**: Direct integration with leading Solana DeFi platforms
- **Real-time Analytics**: Live APY tracking and performance metrics
- **Smart Contract Abstraction**: Complex DeFi interactions simplified into one-click operations
